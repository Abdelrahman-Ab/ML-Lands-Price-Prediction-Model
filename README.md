# ML-Lands-Price-Prediction-Model
Our project, developed for our machine learning course, focuses on the prediction of land prices using advanced machine learning models and deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as ResNet and VGG16.

The primary objective of this project is to forecast land prices by leveraging various factors including the land's location, area, uniqueness of the location, soil type (suitability for construction or agriculture), availability of utilities, pollution levels, and even the analysis of land images.

To accomplish this, we have curated a dataset by meticulously collecting data ourselves. Furthermore, we have augmented this dataset to enhance its size and quality, and diligently preprocessed the data to ensure its cleanliness and reliability for training our models.

By integrating these diverse features into our predictive models, we aim to create a robust system that can effectively estimate land prices based on a comprehensive set of factors, thereby offering valuable insights for real estate stakeholders and enthusiasts.

Throughout this project, our team is committed to exploring innovative techniques in machine learning and deep learning to tackle the challenging task of land price prediction, with the ultimate goal of delivering accurate and actionable predictions in the realm of real estate valuation.
